# Vehicle Detection
This is the final project in term 1 for the [Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive). The goal of the project is to create a pipeline for detecting cars in either images or a video stream.


The writeup for the project is within the jupyter notebook it was written in - `Vehicle Detection Project.ipynb` - and output videos from the project are in `output_images`
